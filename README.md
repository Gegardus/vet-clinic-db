This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. 
**Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
